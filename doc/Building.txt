To build ECT, you need to recursively clone it, just downloading isn’t enough, i. e. git clone --recursive https://github.com/fhanau/Efficient-Compression-Tool.git

Makefile Build:
Use the Makefile to build dependencies and the binary:
cd src/
make

Xcode Build (Mac only):
Build the dependencies first:
cd src/
make deps
Then, open the Xcode Project and compile the program.

(For MP3 Support (Images in MP3 files are recompressed), define MP3_SUPPORTED in main.c and link id3lib(id3lib.sourceforge.net).) This code has been disabled as metadata might get corrupted.

Dependencies:
CMake
Make
NASM

Tested Operating Systems and Compilers:
Debian Wheezy (GCC)
Mac OS X 10.10 (GCC and LLVM/Clang)
Windows 8 (MinGW)
For using other compilers than GCC, you may need to change the Makefile.
