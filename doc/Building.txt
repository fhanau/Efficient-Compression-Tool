Makefile Build:
Use the Makefile to build  dependencies and the binary:
cd src/
make deps
make

Xcode Build (Mac only):
Build the dependencies first:
cd src/
make deps
Then, open the Xcode Project and compile the program.


If you want Support for optimizing all files in a folder, you need to link the Boost.Filesystem and Boost.System libraries (boost.org) and define BOOST_SUPPORTED in main.cpp.
This is already done in the Xcode project. In both cases you need to have Boost installed.

For MP3 Support (Images in MP3 files are recompressed), define MP3_SUPPORTED in main.c and link id3lib(id3lib.sourceforge.net).

Dependencies:
Make
NASM
Boost (optional)

Tested Operating Systems and Compilers:
Debian Wheezy (GCC)
Mac OS X 10.10 (GCC and LLVM/Clang)
Windows 8 (MinGW)
For using other compilers than GCC, you may need to change the Makefile.
